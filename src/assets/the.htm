<p>We understand – <strong>plans change</strong>! There are a lot of unknowns when booking a ticket so far in advance: What if I’m out of the country? What if my friends can’t go? What if I forgot about that wedding I had to attend? We want to make it as easy as possible to book a ticket to an event, as early as possible, without having to worry about anything else. This is precisely why we built our own ‘Book Now, Sell Anytime’ feature – a first of its kind by an Indian ticketing platform.</p>



<p><strong>So how does it work?</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Customers can buy tickets to their favorite event as soon as they go live on the Zomato app.</li>



<li>If their plans change for any reason, they can list their ticket on the Zomato app for a price <strong>lower</strong> or <strong>higher</strong> than their original purchase price (capped at 2x of the current phase price live on the ticketing platform).</li>



<li>Once another customer purchases this listed ticket, the seller’s ticket is canceled and a new ticket is issued to the customer purchasing this ticket – issued and authenticated by Zomato.</li>



<li>The seller will get the full value of their listed price transferred to their preferred payment method (subject to applicable taxes).</li>
</ol>



<p>Our hope is that this feature is utilized for the right reasons by our genuine customers. We also want to ensure this does not promote ill practices in the events industry such as black market touting or unfair pricing. Therefore, we have put a few checks and balances in place:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>A customer can buy up to 10 tickets per category which can be listed for selling.</li>



<li>The highest price at which they can list their tickets will be capped at 2x of the current phase price on the Zomato app – if the tickets for the event are sold out, the cap will be 2x the final phase price.<br/><em>For example – if a customer purchased an Early Bird ticket for Rs.1000 and the current phase is live at Rs 2000, the customer can list their ticket for any price up to Rs. 4000.</em></li>
</ol>



<p>We hope this new feature empowers all our customers and removes any second-guessing about being able to book tickets in advance to events they love. The feature will go live on the Zomato app on September 30th 2024 starting with the Zomato Feeding India Concert. This is another step towards building a truly customer-first platform and growing this industry in India.</p>



<p>We will continue to grow and evolve this initiative as we go along. This is surely not how this feature will look in a few months/years from now, so it is important for the industry to talk to us with the spirit of “we are all part of the same team”.</p>

It is important for food and beverage pictures displayed on a restaurant partner\u0026#8217;s menu to be shot at the right angles, zoom levels, and backgrounds for them to be appealing to the customers. Every day, we receive an incredible 10,000+ food photos from our restaurant partners, many taken directly on their mobile phones. However, not all photos meet the quality standards and we believe that good quality photos are crucial in helping customers decide what to order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis led us to a question: how can we empower our restaurant partners to capture professional-quality photos without requiring Zedi-level photography skills or expensive equipment?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnter PicNic AI (Picture Nicely AI), our culinary maestro of image enhancement. We asked ourselves, \u003cem\u003e\u0026#8220;Can we help our restaurant partners to benefit from the power of AI by elevating their basic food pictures into something that was shot by a photographer in a studio using a professional camera?\u003c/em\u003e\u0026#8221; The answer was a resounding YES! We wanted every dish, whether from your cozy neighborhood joint or that five-star restaurant up the hill, to look so irresistible that you would want to devour it on the spot. And that’s where Zomato\u0026#8217;s innovative ML team began on a journey to build PicNic AI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeveloping PicNic AI\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo bring our vision to life, our team turned to an AI model called Stable Diffusion. Stable Diffusion is a generative AI model that excels at transforming input signals into stunning images. It combines the power of deep learning with advanced Diffusion Generative AI to produce visually appealing and realistic results using a text prompt that describes how the produced image looks. However, to truly showcase the original dish uploaded by the restaurant, we needed the InPainting Variant of Stable Diffusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe InPainting Variant of Stable Diffusion allows us to seamlessly integrate the original dish into a professionally enhanced background. It also enables us to further control and guide the image generation process by providing an image mask that instructs the model to alter and generate only certain portions of the image while leaving the other portions untouched.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe model goes beyond merely generating the background; It also completes any cropped portions, fixing zooming inconsistencies, adjusting color balance, and even upscaling the image to higher resolutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"640\" height=\"308\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/zomatoblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image1-1.png?resize=640%2C308\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13272\" style=\"width:656px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/zomatoblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image1-1.png?resize=1024%2C492\u0026amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/zomatoblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image1-1.png?resize=300%2C144\u0026amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/zomatoblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image1-1.png?resize=768%2C369\u0026amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/zomatoblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image1-1.png?w=1125\u0026amp;ssl=1 1125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"640\" height=\"326\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/zomatoblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image3-1.png?resize=640%2C326\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13273\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/zomatoblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image3-1.png?resize=1024%2C522\u0026amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/zomatoblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image3-1.png?resize=300%2C153\u0026amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/zomatoblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image3-1.png?resize=768%2C391\u0026amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/zomatoblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image3-1.png?w=1125\u0026amp;ssl=1 1125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"640\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/zomatoblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image2.png?resize=640%2C343\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13275\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/zomatoblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image2.png?resize=1024%2C549\u0026amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/zomatoblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image2.png?resize=300%2C161\u0026amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/zomatoblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image2.png?resize=768%2C412\u0026amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/zomatoblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image2.png?w=1125\u0026amp;ssl=1 1125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGuiding the Magic: Image Mask and Text Prompts\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe process begins with the original image uploaded by the restaurant partner.

That\u0026#8217;s where the Text Prompts come into play.
